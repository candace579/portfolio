<h2>
About Me:</h2> <p> I am 23 years old and a current graduate from Youngstown State University. 
I live in New Brighton, Pennsylvania which is about 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh. 
I have three cats, two of which are polydactyl, meaning they have extra toes.
My major is in <b>Computer Science</b> and I have a minor in <b>Mathematics</b>. I hope to one day 
be a part of Frontend Development or Computer Forensics. I love to figure 
things out for myself and I am very determined in that aspect.
